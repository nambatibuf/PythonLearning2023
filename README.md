## My Achievements

I'm proud to share that I've successfully completed this Python programming course, and here are some of my accomplishments:

- **Fundamentals**: I grasped the basics of Python, including setting up my development environment, understanding syntax, and manipulating data.

- **Functions**: I learned how to define and use functions effectively, work with parameters, and manage variable scope.

- **Strings**: I became proficient in string manipulation, formatting, and regular expressions.

- **Conditionals**: I mastered conditional statements, including if, elif, and else clauses, and how to use logical operators.

- **Lists and Tuples**: I gained expertise in working with lists, tuples, and list comprehensions.

- **Loops**: I learned how to use for and while loops, as well as loop control statements.

- **Dictionaries and Sets**: I became adept at handling dictionaries and sets, including their operations and combinations.

- **Lambda, Filters, Maps, Sorted**: I understood the power of lambda functions, filtering and mapping data, and sorting techniques.

- **Error Handling**: I can now handle exceptions gracefully and even create custom exceptions when needed.

- **Functions Revisited**: I explored advanced concepts like recursive functions, decorators, and more.

- **Miscellaneous Topics**: I gained exposure to various topics, such as file I/O, regular expressions, and working with libraries.

- **Object Oriented Programming**: I embraced OOP principles, including classes, inheritance, and encapsulation.

- **SQL with SQLite**: I learned about databases, SQLite operations, and executing SQL queries in Python.

- **NumPy and Pandas**: I delved into data manipulation with NumPy arrays and data analysis using Pandas DataFrames.

- **Plotting in Python**: I can create informative data visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- **Machine Learning**: I got an introduction to machine learning, including data preprocessing and model building and evaluation.

## Assignments and Mini Projects

I successfully completed a total of 9 assignments and 2 mini projects, which demonstrate my practical skills in Python programming. You can find the details and my submissions for each assignment and project in their respective folders within this repository.
